# Module10_Challenge
Submission for Bryan Tran Lu.

## Description
This assignment explores unsupervised learning models on a cryptocurrency dataset. The data is cleaned using StandardScaler, and the optimal value of 'k' is calculate using using a KMeans model followed by plotting an Elbow Curve. The number of features are reduced and the data is assessed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Elbow curves and cluster plots are compared at the end of the script.

## Instructions
The assignment script can be found in the Starter_Code folder. The file name is `crypto_investments.ipynb`.

## Installation Requirements
Import the following packages before running the script.
```python
import pandas as pd
import hvplot.pandas
from pathlib import Path
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
```
